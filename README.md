# Mini-Project
Accident Identification System using GSM and GPS

✔ Problem Statement :

 ✏ Now-a-days, it became very difficult to know that an accident has occurred and to locate the position where it has happened, also many deaths occur due to lack of prompt        medical Attention. 

 ✏ In such situation, informing to family members through mobile to rescue him for an extent. 

 ✏ The project aims at the security and safety of the bikers against road accidents, also to get proper and prompt medical attention, after meeting with an accident.
 
 
 ✔ Objective :

 ✏ The objective of this project is to detect accident and alert the guardian about accident and prevent life.

 ✏ It first detects accident and send s.m.s to the guardian about accident and then send the location to the registered mobile number.

 ✏ Developing the accident-related traffic management system.
 
 ✔ Proposed System :

 ✏ The accident identification system has a GSM module , GPS module ,a LCD , ACCELEROMETER and ARDUINO UNO.
    
 ✏ When accident has occurred, the location details of vehicle is collected by the GPS module from the satellite, this information is in the form of latitude and longitude           scale.

 ✏ Thus collected information is then fed to Arduino Uno . Necessary processing is done and the information is passed to LCD and GSM module.
    
 ✏ The GSM module collects the information for Arduino uno and then transfer it to the mobile phone through the SMS which is in text format.
 
 
 ✔ Application :

 ✏ These system will informed the accident location accurately which save causality 

 ✏ This project would make a motorcycle journey more protected and safer.
